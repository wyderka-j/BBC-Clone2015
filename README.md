Clone Of BBC Website

Link to created website: https://wyderka-j.github.io/BBC-Clone2015/

I tried to clone the bbc website home page from 2015 by using HTML and CSS alone. So the site is not interactively presently because there was no javascript involved.
Website was created based on the course available on the website Udemy "Learn HTML & CSS: How To Start Your Web Development Career".
